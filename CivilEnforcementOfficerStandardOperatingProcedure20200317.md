## Introduction

The management of Civil Parking Enforcement within the County of Devon by the
Council will:

- Maintain and, where possible, improve the flow of traffic thereby making the
County a more pleasant and environmentally safe place to live and visit.
- Take into account the needs of local residents, shops and businesses,
thereby sustaining the County and District Council’s economic growth.
- Actively support the needs of disabled people bearing in mind that, in some
cases, they are unable to use public transport and are entirely dependent
upon the use of a car. This will ensure that people with disabilities are able to
have equal access to all facilities within the County.
- Actively discourage indiscriminate parking that causes obstruction to other
motorists, public transport, pedestrians, cyclists and people with disabilities.
This will ensure that the Districts remain accessible to all equally and safely.

The policy shall be regularly reviewed and will take into account:

a) Existing and predicted levels of demand for parking.

b) The availability and pricing of both on and off -street parking.

c) The nature and extent of on-street parking restrictions.

d) The accuracy and quality of existing signs and plates.

e) The level of compliance that Devon County Council considers acceptable
and the level of enforcement necessary to achieve them.

f) The views of the public who shall be actively consulted on all matters relating
to the extension of parking restrictions.

g) The views of the Devon & Cornwall Constabulary.

h) The provision of suitable parking facilities for disabled people.

i) The provision of suitable parking facilities for cyclists and motorcyclists.

j) Consideration of the Council’s overall aims with regard to the environment,
and the sustained economic growth of the County and District Councils.

k) Changes to the enforcement regime as a result of changes to legislation,
statutory guidance or best practice.

Enforcement of parking controls

Parking controls were decriminalised under the Road Traffic Act 1991 (which was
replaced by the Traffic Management Act 2004, implemented in 2008). The provisions


of the Road Traffic Act resulted in the ability of local authorities to apply for the
powers to become responsible for the enforcement of parking and other restrictions
throughout their own areas. Devon County Council adopted these powers in 2008
and enforcement is carried out using a direct workforce of trained Civil Enforcement
Officers (CEOs).

Enforcement of parking controls can take place at any time when restrictions apply.
For double yellow lines this is 24 hours and across the County there are residents only
parking areas which are operational 24 hours daily.

In order to best utilise resource, deployment will be planned and prioritised,
managed, intelligence led and not fitting into any predictable pattern. It is managed at
local level by Operation Team Leaders, supported by Senior CEOs with input of local
knowledge and feedback from CEO’s on the ground.

In practice, enforcement in Devon is concentrated during the hours of 7am and 6pm,
including Sundays and Bank Holidays, when the majority of restrictions are in force.
Bank Holidays and Sunday trading are relied upon by many small businesses in our
region for a large part of their income. It is important that enforcement is undertaken
on these days to ensure that the network is managed efficiently and safely and visitors
and shoppers access to available on street parking is readily available.

Bank holidays are not the same as ‘Sundays’ and our enforcement officers will enforce
restrictions and times as they are signed on the street. Where an exemption applies
for a Bank Holiday the adjacent signs will state ‘except bank holidays’. Where a
variation in restriction times and charges applies in Pay & Display spaces on a bank
holiday, and the machine tariff card will show two sets of charges.

Due to requests from local communities the service is expanding to deliver more
frequent enforcement from 6am to 10pm. Enforcement outside of these hours is
usually carried out in response to special needs.

Deployment of CEOs will generally be aimed at larger urban communities with a high
demand for parking management. Some key communities, such as Exeter,
Barnstaple and Newton Abbot can expect an “all day, every day” presence. For other
town communities there will not necessarily be a daily attendance but will be planned
without any predictable pattern. Smaller, rural communities will be serviced more on
a reactive basis.

The Council does not currently remove or clamp vehicles, or enforce restrictions using
CCTV cameras, so enforcement is carried out through CEOs patrolling and issuing
Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) to vehicles parked in contravention of the regulations.
We do however have powers to remove vehicles belonging to persistent offenders,
and whilst rare this may occur.

CEOs undertake a comprehensive training programme before enforcing the
regulations within local communities.

CEOs use hand held computers to record observations of vehicles and to issue PCNs.
These computers have many safeguards to ensure that notices are issued
correctly, and that the correct information is gathered to support the issue of the PCN.
In addition, CEOs make comprehensive notes on their hand held units, at times
supplemented with further details in their pocketbooks. Photographs of vehicles parked
in contravention are also generally taken when they issue a PCN. This evidence is
made available to drivers who query the issue of a PCN.


The Council takes the protection of CEOs very seriously and in addition to the training
they have received in Health and Safety and conflict management, risk
assessments have been carried out on their roles and all CEOs have body worn
camera or other corporate safety measures, in the event of threats whilst they are
carrying out their duties.

Parking Enforcement **–** general aims

The parking regime in Devon is designed to achieve the following policy objectives –

- To encourage a high level of compliance by motorists with the parking
controls and waiting and loading restrictions.
- To integrate traffic management policies with effective on-street enforcement
to improve road safety and the movement of public transport and to reduce
congestion by encouraging the free flow of traffic.
- To ensure the equitable distribution and management of the availability of
parking space.
- To discourage long term parking in streets close to town centres.
- To provide dedicated on-street enforcement.
- To be responsive to changing priorities, local factors and demand.
- To provide parking permits and exemptions for residents and businesses, the
disabled, and others as appropriate.

The way in which parking restrictions are enforced is designed to meet these aims.
Clearly, it is essential that traffic flow is maintained and illegally parked vehicles
may cause congestion and compromise the safety of other drivers and pedestrians.

Vehicles overstaying in limited waiting spaces or pay and display bays on street may
mean that other vehicles will not be able to park. Reducing the accessibility to shops,
medical facilities or amenities could prove damaging to trade or put the well being of
others at risk.

Non-permit holders parked in permit bays may mean that residents cannot park close
to their homes.

The Traffic Management Act and its associated guidance is clear that parking
enforcement should relate to traffic management objectives and cannot be used for
revenue-raising purposes. The County Council endorses and complies fully with
these requirements.

Parking enforcement will be ‘fair but firm’ and community support for, or acceptance
of parking controls, is conditional upon achieving this balance in the enforcement
operation. The procedures set out in this document have been designed to assist in
this objective and establishes the “ethos” of the way parking enforcement will be
conducted whilst individual areas will minimise the potential for misunderstanding
and dispute over specific parking issues. In general, enforcement activity will comply
with the following principles –

- Fairness in applying the legislation and securing compliance.
- Consistency of approach.
- Transparency about what enforcement action is taken and why.


Parking Controls

The issue of parking enforcement cannot be considered without an understanding of
the basis for parking regulations.

Parking regulations are introduced through the powers contained in the Road Traffic
Regulation Act 1984, which also defines the objectives for which parking regulations
can be introduced. These can be summarised as:

- Safety.
- Maintenance of access to premises.
- Congestion reduction.
- Management of the kerb space where demand for parking exceeds supply.

Raising revenue is not a lawful objective for either introducing or enforcing controls
and this has been reinforced by the Secretary of State in the guidance which
accompanies the Traffic Management Act 2004, stressing that the aim of enforcement
is to encourage compliance with the regulations.

The precise regulations made by the Council will depend on the circumstances at the
location. Regulations introduced for safety reasons or to ensure that access is
maintained for emergency vehicles are more likely to be in the form of double yellow
lines which prevent vehicles from parking at that location. Where congestion
reduction or access to premises for deliveries is the issue, single yellow lines may be
sufficient. Resident parking schemes are introduced in areas when demand exceeds
supply and there is a need to ensure that residents can park more easily, whilst
disabled bays will cater for blue badge holders.

Typically, residents’ permit holders will be given priority in residential areas, while
short stay parking and deliveries will be given priority in commercial and shopping
areas. Double yellow lines and loading restrictions will be introduced for safety
reasons, where parked vehicles could cause danger and compromise traffic flow.

It is not always possible to meet all the demand for parking spaces. In some
residential areas the demand for residents’ parking may be greater than the supply of
spaces. In mixed use areas such as those where shops are situated, there are
competing demands from shoppers, residents and deliveries. The Council must
sometimes make difficult decisions over the allocation of kerb space between these
demands and it may therefore be impossible to accommodate all groups of motorists
to the extent they would wish.

Where there is a particularly high demand for on-street short stay parking, pay and
display bays may be used which encourage a high turnover and enable more effective
enforcement by the CEOs.

The procedure for introducing new restrictions requires that a Traffic Regulation
Order be made and put into place. This is the legal instrument through which the
Council implements most parking restrictions, both on-street and in car parks. Traffic
Regulation Orders are made under the powers contained in the Road Traffic
Regulation Act 1984. The Council must legally consult before introducing controls
and the making of a Traffic Regulation Order follows a statutory process which also
involves public advertisement following consultation and the consideration of any
objections received following advertisement.

On occasions the Council may introduce temporary Traffic Regulation Orders to


cover road works or special events, for a short period of time. Experimental Traffic
Regulation Orders may also be introduced (for up to 18 months) to test controls
where the outcome may not be clear. The trial period also constitutes the
consultation period in this case.

Without a valid Traffic Regulation Order, the Council is not able to legally enforce the
restriction.

Lines and signs

When restrictions are introduced, the Council must lay the correct lines and erect the
proper signs – if these are not in place the restriction cannot be enforced. No signs
are required for double yellow lines, unless they are seasonal (only operational at
certain times of the year). Yellow line restrictions apply from the centre of the road to
the building line, including pavements and verges.

The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 specify in precise detail
the type of line markings and signs that must be used to indicate traffic and parking
restrictions. Where there is an unusual or non-standard type of restriction the
Department for Transport is requested to specifically authorise each sign (and often,
its location).

The Council will take remedial action as soon as possible when problems are
identified, to ensure that all restrictions are clearly marked and signed and can be
properly enforced.

Only when a Traffic Regulation Order, and the correct lines and signs are in place,
can the restriction be enforced.

The following section outlines the Council’s guidelines for the enforcement of parking
restrictions.


## A day in the life of a CEO

Morning Prep Time

All CEOs are on a fixed three-week working pattern.

Within each team, officers will be made aware of their attendance times with a
minimum of 7 days’ notice.

All staff are expected to arrive ready for work by the start of their attendance
time.

If you are unable to attend for any reason you should contact a Senior Civil
Enforcement Officer or Team Leader at the earliest opportunity, if they are
unavailable you should contact the HOCC, and a Senior or Team Leader will
return your call.

The first 15 minutes of a Civil Enforcement Officers day should be spent
preparing for the day ahead. The following is not an exhaustive list but within
15 minutes of the start of the day you should:

- Be wearing all workwear that you need for the day
- Be equipped with tested and functional equipment including Handheld,
    Body Worn Video camera, Printer, Mobile Telephone and that the
    times and dates are correct where applicable.
- Have enough consumables including PCN wallets, spare printer roll
    and test token.
- Ensure that all vehicle checks are completed and that you have
    reported any defects if necessary
- Have checked emails for any new information that has been sent since
    your last working day.
- Have checked Microsoft Teams for any new information about the beat
    that you have been assigned.
- Have checked that there are no customer requests that you need to
    attend to for the day.
- Ensure that you have incorporated the previous two points into your
    beat plan for the day.
- Have agreed the frequency of contact with your partner for the day.

These 15 minutes are important and prepare you for the day. We recommend
that a CEO makes good use of the time and ensures that they are ready to
commence transit to their beat 15 minutes after the start of their day.

We do not expect anyone to race through their checks as quickly as possible
and suggest that if they are completed early, they double check that they are
aware of any issues on their beat and that their equipment is working. Any
excess time would be well spent reviewing their beat plan.


Transit time

If at point during the day, a Civil Enforcement Officer finds themselves
travelling between Base and their beat, their beat to another beat, or in a
vehicle for any reason, they should enter the *Transit* location on their
handheld.

Transit time must be accurate, and you should make sure that you promptly
log into *Transit* whenever you are in transit.

It is important that transit time is recorded so that we can monitor downtime
for the service overall.

Whenever you are moving between base and beats, beats to different beats,
or using a vehicle, you are expected to use the most direct route possible. In
some circumstances, you may have to start a beat in a specific location which
would not be the most direct, such as when a customer request takes you to a
location on the other side of a beat from base. This will only be the case
where a Senior Civil Enforcement Officer or Team Leader has given you the
instruction and will be recorded.

When you are planning your beat, you are expected to make sure that you
maximise time spent enforcing.

We understand that there are variables which can impact transit time when in
remote mobile communities. For this reason, there is no expected pre-
determined time of departure from a beat. However, you should try to ensure
that you are not leaving early, and if you are early, you may be expected to
perform a local beat for the last part of the day.

Beat Plan

As a Civil Enforcement Officer, you are expected to be responsible for your
own time and ensure that you are making good use of it.

It is therefore essential that you plan your days’ work.

When planning your days work, you should aim to visit as many locations as
you can whilst ensure that all restrictions are checked in line with these
procedures.

You will need to be prepared for your plan to be disrupted by long observation
periods and other unexpected events and being able to react flexibly in these
situations is essential.


Routing

As earlier described, your aim should be to cover your beat as thoroughly as
possible whilst ensuring that you deal with all restrictions as you go.

You should not “tick” streets off at the expense of enforcement. If you are
unable to get around a whole beat, then you should plan to get around as
much of it as you can whilst visiting as many priority locations as possible.

Your routing should be purposeful, and it would not be usually acceptable to
zig-zag across a beat randomly. Instead you should move fluidly from one
street to another.

You should consider what streets are usually the busiest, the nature of the
restrictions within a street and how much time you have left before your next
break or the end of your day, when planning your day.

Our primary aim is to manage parking and deal with vehicles parked in
contravention and this should be your focus when routing throughout the day.

The team is experienced and passionate about the role, and we encourage
officers to spend some of their Morning Prep Time to discuss with either a
Senior Civil Enforcement Officer or colleague if they need some tips on a
specific beat.

It is also important to note that different types of beats require different
routing.

For example, you would plan your day very differently depending on whether
you were on North Team Beat One or East Team Beat Six. On a priority beat
there is little / no limited waiting to manage and list of priority streets to visit in
order, with frequency of visits being more important. On a residential beat
there is a large amount of limited waiting to manage, and coverage should be
prioritised up to the point where your limited waiting expires. The two types of
beats require a different approach to manage effectively and if you ever need
advice you should speak to your Senior Civil Enforcement Officer.

Taking Breaks

There are two types of breaks that would be taken during the normal working
day.

Your official rest break is your *Lunch Break* and should be recorded as
such. This is a standard one-hour break and should be taken in the middle of
your working day, although you should plan your break around the
requirements of whichever beat you are on.


Additionally, you may take a *Comfort Break* during the day. This should be
no longer than 30 minutes each day and any transit time incurred because of
this break should be counted towards the time of the break.

Comfort Breaks can be taken at any time except immediately after or before
the start or end of your working day or immediately before or after your lunch
break.

Comfort Breaks could be taken for various reasons, but common ones might
include:

- To refill your flask at Base or another location
- To change uniform at Base
- To stop and briefly rest and take a drink whilst on beat
- To dry off whether on beat, at base or in your vehicle
- To return to your vehicle and change uniform, retrieve a drink etc

Comfort Breaks are there because we recognise that the role of a Civil
Enforcement Officer is different from an office role where it is usually easier to
meet any of the above needs.

For the avoidance of doubt, *Transit* time incurred whilst on route to a Lunch
Break location does not count towards the total time.

Returning to Base

You should aim to return to base between 15 and 10 minutes before the end
of your working day.

This time should be used to debrief, download equipment and ensure that you
have shared any important information with the duty Senior Civil Enforcement
Officer, or send them an email if they are unavailable.

Please be aware that if you are significantly early with no cause then you may
have to patrol a nearby beat until a more appropriate time. This is to make
sure that the standard is kept to.

Accurate Recording

It is extremely important to make sure that your handheld records are
accurate. The information that you put into your handheld is regularly reported
to other teams, Councillors and other stakeholders.

Downtime should always be recorded as *Transit* and all activities that are
not enforcement related should be recorded as *Other Duties* and be
authorised and recorded by a Senior Civil Enforcement Officer or Team
Leader.


Morning Preparation time and the time you spend at Base at the end of the
day should be recorded as *Base* as should any other time spent at base that
is not another duty.

Whilst you are on Lunch you should enter *Lunch Break* on your handheld
and whilst on comfort break you should enter *Comfort Break*.

During your patrol, you should enter each location as you enter it and remain
logged into it for as long as you are physically in that location. You should
promptly and pre-emptively change locations as you are patrolling, ensuring
that you are in the same location in your handheld as you are physically.

We accept that mistakes can occur but for the avoidance of doubt you must
not intentionally enter streets that you are not physically present in to
artificially inflate your visits statistic, or to make it appear like you are patrolling
somewhere you are not. This is referred to as “Ghosting”.

“Ghosting” is the act of entering locations or vehicles that are not present or
that are falsified to make it appear like you are performing at a higher level
than is true or to hide a lack of productivity. It is strictly forbidden and will be
treated as gross misconduct.

Use of Council Vehicles

Drivers of council owned vehicles must always obey the rules of the road. The
use of hands free devices, whilst legal, is forbidden whilst driving a works
vehicle.

Although CEOs possess an exemption for parking when dealing with matters
of enforcement, it is essential use of this exemption is minimised wherever
possible. When making use of this exception a CEO should report the reason
to their SCEO on return to base.

It is not acceptable to park in limited waiting for longer than the permitted
period.

CEOs should restrict their parking to residents’ bays, pay and display bays
and unrestricted parking. A CEO may park on a yellow line to enforce against
a vehicle parked in the same location only in extreme circumstances.


## Principles of Enforcement

Ensuring Consistency

Your absolute priority is to enforce against all vehicles that you come across
in the same way as everyone else. The guidelines and processes in this
document should be followed in all circumstances and it is not acceptable to
deviate for any reason.

If during your patrol you encounter a situation which you believe to be unique
and not detailed in this document, or guidance within ‘teams’, you should get
in touch with a Senior Civil Enforcement Officer. If this is found to be the case,
a process will be developed and added to an updated version of this
document.

An individual enforcement officer has no discretion whilst on patrol. We will
incorporate any grace periods and other assurances into these guidelines.

We cannot stress how important it is that all enforcement officers operate
consistently and deal with each situation in the same manner as one another.

Consistency promotes fairness and ensures that officers and the authority are
protected from criticisms and allegations of corruption. It also ensures that
rules are clear to customers and that they can expect the same treatment
regardless of the officer they are dealing with. All team members’ will have
monthly one to ones with a Senior to discuss any issues and clarify and
uncertainties, so any non-urgent matters can be raised for discussion in that
forum. The performance element of the one to one also benchmarks each
individuals’ performance against these consistent standards and agrees
actions as required. A copy of the standards reviewed in the one to one are in
appendix i.

A copy of this document is available on all Microsoft Team channels used by
Civil Enforcement Officers and we expect that it will regularly be referred to in
order to ensure that there is a consistent approach.

There may be rare occasions when you may be unable to get through to a
Senior Civil Enforcement Officer, Team Leader or be able to access Teams. If
this is the case and you are unsure of what to do, then you should not take
enforcement action. You should record exactly what occurred in an email to a
SCEO, describing the circumstance and why you did not feel able to act. You
should attach a photograph to the email. You can draft an email even if you
do not have data or signal. In these circumstances, you should expect for this
to be discussed with you later and we would encourage you to discuss this
with the duty Senior at the end of the day if they are available.

Principles of Engagement

When an officer encounters a vehicle that is in contravention, they should
immediately log it in their handheld computer to begin an observation. This


should be the case regardless of occupants or any conversation that may
occur.

Once a vehicle has been observed you should attempt to engage any driver
or passengers present in conversation. You should take additional care if a
passenger appears to be vulnerable in any way, for example, a child.

During the conversation you should advise that you have observed the vehicle
and try to ascertain if the vehicle may be involved in exemptible activity. If the
vehicle could be considered exempt, then you should delete the observation
and move along. If the vehicle cannot be considered exempt then you should
advise the occupant that you are going to continue your observation and after
a prescribed period, issue a PCN unless the vehicle is moved, or exemptible
activity is seen.

Even if you have already had a conversation with a driver, you must offer
them one final opportunity to move once the observation has elapsed before
you issue a penalty charge notice.

If you are patrolling a busy location where there are multiple cars parked, for
example, in a loading bay, then you should observe all these vehicles on the
handheld before starting to have discussions with any present occupants.

Issuing a PCN

A vehicle is in contravention if it is parked where there is a restriction and you
cannot ascertain in an objective manner whether it is exempt.

Under these circumstances, you follow the process of issuing a penalty
charge notice, unless before you issue the PCN the vehicle is moved, or you
personally witness exemptible activity.

A PCN is considered issued once you have passed the “point of no return” on
the handheld. This is after the observation has been completed and you have
confirmed that the vehicle is still present.

After this point you must not cancel the PCN unless you have made a
mistake, in which case you should record why you have cancelled the PCN as
a text note against the case.

PCNs should be attached to a vehicle when possible. There are three
acceptable locations for this.

On a car, the primary location is affixed to the windscreen on the passenger
side approximately half way up the windscreen so that it would be directly in
front of a passenger if they were sat in the vehicle. If the windscreen is too
wet to allow for this, you should place the PCN gently under the drivers side
windscreen wiper. A photograph of this is in the appendices. On a Motorcycle,
you should wrap the PCN around the left handlebar.


If the vehicle is moved after this point, but you are not able to attach the PCN
to the vehicle, then it should be served as a Vehicle Drive Away (VDA). There
will always be a conversation to go with this unless the driver ignores you, in
which case, a detailed text note will always be made against a PCN served
this way. This note should explain the circumstance of the VDA, conversation
taken place and why PCN could not be affixed as normal.

If you have seen the driver or spoken to one you need to make a relevant
note in your handheld.

Observation Periods

Observation periods are prescribed to ensure that all officers are observing for
the same amount of time before a penalty charge notice is issued.

You must not willingly allow additional observation time under any
circumstances.

There will be occasions where you are forced to allow extra observation time,
such as where you issue multiple PCNs at the same time or are distracted by
a customer. Under these circumstances you must make a text note against
the case detailing why there was additional observation time.

Additionally, you should not attempt to circumvent the observation periods in
any way and you should ensure that you allow the prescribed observation
under all circumstances.

Usually where loading is permitted, a normal vehicle such as a car, would be
given 5 minutes observation. A commercial vehicle should be treated the
same and given 5 minutes. A liveried multi drop vehicle would be given 20
minutes casual observation, followed by 5 minutes constant observation.

Where loading is not permitted, observation times are typically 1 minute for all
vehicles, or in some cases, instant.

Health and safety

Everyone has responsibility to health and safety. There are risk assessments
for the service and team which everyone has responsibility to read, act upon
and raise concerns/changes that may impact these risk assessments. If you
have a concern regarding your own or a colleagues health and safety you
need to raise this with a Senior/TL.


## Contraventions

This section will focus on specific processes for contraventions and is to be
used as a reference guide when on street. It will not go into details about the
full legal wording of a contravention code and there are other resources for
that, but rather give an overview into a contravention, observation times and
any exemptions that may apply.

Please note that further details regarding permits, what each exemption is
defined as and other useful information can be found in the A-Z section of this
document, which you should refer to if something is unclear.

## A-Z

In this section we aim to provide a comprehensive list of all possible situations
and matters that may arise during your working day with a standard approach
to dealing with them.

Care has been taken to ensure that where matters are similar, such as permit
expiry, there are similar approaches to make it simpler for you to manage your
day but also so that customers experience consistency across various issues

We recognise that there are hundreds of things that can happen throughout
the day but there must be a simple and objective solution to every problem to
make sure that matters are dealt with objectively.


Abandoned Vehicles

Abandoned vehicles are the jurisdiction of District and City Councils.

Once a vehicle has visibly received its third penalty charge notice the officer
issuing the third PCN should report the vehicle to the local District or City
Council via the link on their Teams Page.

If you encounter a vehicle that has three PCNs on the windscreen you should
check them. If these are all for the location that the vehicle is parked in, then
you should refrain from issuing further PCNs.

If the PCNs are for a different location then you should issue a PCN.

Arrested Driver

Any claims that a driver has been arrested should be ignored unless you are
told by a uniformed Police Officer or a non-uniformed Police Officer who
presents you his badge or warrant card.

Under these circumstances you should not enforce against the vehicle.

Bailiffs (Debt Enforcement Officers)

Whilst a bailiff is executing a warrant they will need their vehicle nearby and
will be allowed to park as close as is reasonably necessary.

Whilst a bailiff is serving a warrant or summons then they are expected to
comply with the parking restrictions as normal.

Whilst a bailiff is taking goods from a property they are expected to comply
with normal loading and unloading procedures and are only exempt where
that exemption applies.

Bank Holidays

Unless a sign or tariff card states otherwise all restrictions in Devon apply in
the same way on Bank Holidays as they do on other days and you should
treat them as such.

Bank Visits

When a cash in transit vehicle is taking money to and from the bank they
should be allowed to park as close as reasonably possible.

Any other visit to the bank, including business owners taking money to the
bank are not to be considered exempt. Visits to the bank to deposit money are
not considered loading.


If someone is carrying coinage of a heavy or bulky nature, then it can be
considered loading but if you cannot visibly see anything being carried then it
would not be considered loading.

Matters of personal safety are not our concern.

Blue Badges

A Blue Badge must always be displayed to be considered valid. It is not
acceptable for a motorist to show you their blue badge and then put it away.

When parked on a yellow line, a Blue Badge must be accompanied by a time
clock indicating the time of arrival. If this time of arrival is more than 3 hours
away, rounded to the nearest quarter an hour on the badge, then a PCN
should be issued. The PCN will be issued for the original contravention, not
for an invalid permit.

You should not second guess the clock. If it is 15:00 and the clock is
displaying the time of 03:20 / 15:20 you must interpret the badge as seen. In
this instance you would issue a PCN.

An expired blue badge is offered no grace period and is considered invalid the
day after its expiry.

Any notes concerning a blue badge, such as that there is one in the post or
that they have applied for a new one should be ignored and photographed
during the PCN process.

You must not confiscate Blue Badges or ask to inspect them. If you suspect a
badge is being used fraudulently you can report this through the link on your
Teams page.

A driver is responsible for ensuring that they display the badge correctly.

Boarding and Alighting

Except for clearways and zig-zags, vehicles are permitted to stop for a
reasonable amount of time to allow a passenger to enter or exit the vehicle.

There is no time limit on how long this should take but typically it will be
shorter than any observation period on a restriction where it is permitted and
therefore will be simple to assess.

The only time it would be acceptable for a driver to get out of the vehicle and
assist the boarding and alighting is when the passenger could be considered
vulnerable such as when it is a child or if they need assistance to get out of a
vehicle, such as being in a wheelchair.


Break Downs

Any note claiming a vehicle has broken down should be ignored and a PCN
issued. No matter what documentation is presented on the dashboard the
same applies.

If someone tells you their vehicle is broken down, this does not immediately
exempt them from the rules. A PCN should be issued but the appeals
procedure should be advised.

If a driver claims that the vehicle is immobile a PCN should be issued, text
notes made, and the appeals process advised.

Running out of fuel is the fault of the driver and PCN should be issued.

Builders / Tradespersons

Parking in contravention will only be considered acceptable whilst loading /
unloading of tools and materials is taking place.

Notes should be ignored, and no grace should be given.

Builders and tradespersons may be eligible for an annual trade permit and
you should provide them a leaflet.

Bus Stops

You can only enforce in a bus stop that has a sign. Buses that are waiting in a
bus stop are exempt but buses that are unattended in a bus stop should be
issued a penalty charge notice.

Carers Permit

Carers have a two part permit, with a clock being displayed and a virtual
permit confirming its validity.

A vehicle needs to be displaying a clock and have a valid virtual permit to be
considered exemptible.

Carers permits are valid on yellow lines for a maximum of one hour, and for
an unlimited time in permitted parking.

If you find a vehicle displaying a clock but there is no virtual permit, you
should issue a PCN. In Residents Parking this should be a code 19.

If you find a vehicle with a valid virtual permit but no clock, you should issue a
PCN. In Residents Parking this should be a code 19.


If you find a vehicle parked on yellow lines with a valid virtual permit and a
clock, and the clock has been set more then one hour and 11 minutes ago,
you should issue a PCN. This should be a code 01.

Casual Observation

A casual observation is a method of observing certain types of vehicles in
certain locations.

A casual observation begins with an initial observation made on the handheld
under the relevant code. If the location you are in takes 20 minutes to patrol,
then you return to the vehicle before constantly observing it for 5 more
minutes. If you see no activity during this time, then you should issue a PCN.

The majority of locations do not take 20 minutes to patrol.

If you have a vehicle under casual observation you can leave the location and
if it is still present the next time you return to the location, you should observe
it for 5 more minutes before issuing a PCN.

Casual observation almost exclusively applies to courier vehicles however it
can apply to other vehicles as outlined in the contravention guide.

Chimney Sweeps

When engaged in chimney sweeping, with a notice stating the location of the
driver, chimney sweeps can be permitted the same exemptions as a window
cleaner.

Clamps

When a car has been clamped a PCN should be issued if it is parked in
contravention. The decision to park in contravention was made by the driver
before they were clamped.

CEO Vehicles

Drivers of council owned vehicles must always obey the rules of the road. The
use of hands free devices, whilst legal, is forbidden whilst driving a works
vehicle.

Although CEOs possess an exemption for parking when dealing with matters
of enforcement, it is essential use of this exemption is minimised wherever
possible. When making use of this exception a CEO should report the reason
to their SCEO on return to base.

It is not acceptable to park in limited waiting for longer than the permitted
period.


CEOs should restrict their parking to residents’ bays, pay and display bays
and unrestricted parking. A CEO may park on a yellow line to enforce against
a vehicle parked in the same location only in extreme circumstances.

Commercial Vehicles

For the purposes of enforcement, a commercial vehicle will be treated no
differently to any other ordinary vehicle. Commercial vehicles are not exempt
from restrictions by the nature of their vehicle, only if they are involved in
exemptible activity.

Complaints against CEOs

Correspondence about the service of a PCN will be dealt with under normal
Representations or Challenge procedures, by the processing team.

Any complaints received about the conduct of CEOs, or the service delivered
by the team will be investigated by the operations team.

Council Officers and elected Councillors

All Councils expect their officers to park safely and to observe parking
restrictions.

Unless a vehicle is being used for enabling the Council to perform a statutory
duty or for carrying out essential work then it must abide by the normal
regulations.

Councillors are not exempt from parking restrictions.

Notes saying that a vehicle is being used by the Council should be ignored
and PCN issued.

Couriers

Professional courier services in marked vehicles such as DPD, DHL and UPS
parked where loading is permitted should be given either a 20 minute
constant observation or 20 minutes casual observation followed by 5 minutes
constant observation.

Discretion

You are not permitted to exercise any personal discretion under any
circumstances. Under no circumstances are you to allow someone to park in
contravention, enter premises to warn drivers they will receive a PCN or
permit parking due to a note or after being told where the driver is.

You must treat all vehicles in the exact manner described in this document.


This will reduce the likelihood of criticism and complaints against you and your
colleagues.

Doctors and other medical professionals

During routine or pre planned visits Doctors and other medical professionals
such as midwives or district nurses are not considered exempt and should
comply with the parking restrictions.

If a medical professional is attending an emergency, they would be
considered exempt as long as they have left a headed laminate detailing the
nature of their role and that they are attending a medical emergency.

Dropped Kerbs

To enforce a dropped kerb, it needs to have tactile paving stones, lead to a
driveway / private road or have another dropped kerb in a straight line away
from it.

Where the dropped kerb leads to a driveway, the person for whom the
dropped kerb has been marked (i.e. the householder) can park his/her own
vehicle on the dropped kerb and may also give permission for someone else,
such as a visitor, to park on the dropped kerb.

This means that the Council have no way of knowing whether a vehicle
parked on a dropped kerb belongs to the householder or has the
householder’s permission to park there. In view of this, the Council can only
enforce if a complaint is received from the householder. When a complaint is
made, if possible, a CEO will be sent to the site and will issue a PCN in
accordance with the guidelines detailed below.

- Householder must be at home and identify themselves to the CEO
    upon arrival.
- Confirm/identify with the CEO the details of the vehicle reported.
- The reported vehicle is still parked in contravention and is overhanging
    the area of the kerb dropped to carriageway level to facilitate access to
    a driveway.

Double Parking

Any instance of a vehicle being parked more than 50cm from the edge of the
carriageway will be enforced against using a code 26. This includes double
parking.

This applies even in a location where there are no parking restrictions.

Estate Agents


Estate agents visiting a client’s property are not exempt from parking
restrictions and should comply with the regulations when attending valuations
or viewings.

Estate agents may be eligible for an annual trade permit and they should be
provided a leaflet.

Emergency Utilities

Vehicles displaying a laminated business headed note claiming they are
involved in emergency water, heating, gas or electrical works can be
considered exempt in permitted parking if they leave a contact telephone
number and location.

You should always call this number and make sure that they are working. If
there is no answer, or they are not working, you should issue a PCN.
If the works are pre-planned or last for more than one day, then the exemption
does not apply.

This exemption only applies for as long as it takes for the tradesperson to
make the situation safe, for example, turning off the gas mains.

These drivers may be eligible for a trade permit and should be provided a
leaflet.

Funerals and Weddings

The principle vehicle involved in a wedding or funeral (Bridal Car or Hearse)
are considered exempt from parking restrictions and should not be issued a
PCN.

Mourners or wedding guests are expected to comply with the regulations and
should not be parked in contravention.

Although the service operates a policy of proactively avoiding a presence at
these events unless otherwise requested, there are occasions where you will
accidentally patrol into them. In these circumstances it is acceptable to
contact a SCEO or TL for further advice.

Glaziers

Any professional glazier who is involved in an emergency repair to a
storefront or window will be considered exempt from restrictions except
clearways and school or pedestrian zig-zags.

Any professional glazier who must install a large storefront sized pane of
glass which is pre-arranged will also be considered exempt except for the
same restrictions.


Both activities should be immediately obvious to you and if you cannot see
any work being carried out a glazier’s vehicle is not exempt by default.

Any pre-planned glazing works, such as refitting home windows, would not be
covered by this exemption.

Glaziers may be eligible for an annual trade permit and should be provided a
leaflet.

Hazardous or Toxic Substances

Where applicable this would be considered loading so long as you witness the
activity.

If a vehicle is displaying a note saying that they are involved in this sort of
work, it should be ignored, and the appropriate observation time given. If there
is no loading seen within the observation period, then a PCN should be
issued.

Hire Cars / Courtesy Cars

These should be treated in the same manner as any other vehicle. A hire car
or courtesy car does not inherit the qualities of its drivers’ other vehicles.

Residents may be able to obtain a temporary permit and should be advised
accordingly.

Liveried Multi Drop Vehicles - Observation

This observation begins with an initial observation made on the handheld
under the relevant code. If the location that a vehicle is parked in will take 20
minutes to patrol whilst you can keep the vehicle under constant observation,
then you can proceed with issuing the PCN after 20 minutes of this.

Most locations do not take 20 minutes to patrol.

If you have a vehicle under this type of observation you can leave the location
and if it is still present the next time you return to the location, you should
observe it for 5 more minutes before issuing a PCN. This is called a casual
observation.

This observation almost exclusively applies to courier vehicles however it can
apply to other vehicles as outlined in the contravention guide.

You would only observe a vehicle in this manner if loading is exempt where it
is parking.

Loading / Unloading


Loading is defined as “an item or items of bulk which cannot easily be carried
whilst being taken to and from a vehicle”.

Vehicles are permitted to park where loading is exemptible whilst carrying out
the activity of loading and unloading heavy or awkward items or the delivery
and collection of goods as part of a business activity.

You must never assume a vehicle is involved in loading. You must not accept
any note saying that a vehicle is loading.

The only time that you should accept that a vehicle is involved in this activity
is when you actively see it for yourself. Seeing someone who says they are
loading is not enough.

If you do not physically see loading within the prescribed observation period
for the vehicle in question, then a penalty charge notice should be issued.

Lost Keys

If a driver claims they have lost their keys or a there is a note in or on the vehicle
explaining that they have lost the keys a PCN should be issued.

Motorcycles

Motorcycles are exempt from On Street pay and display, residents parking
and any shared use bay with either of these components.

All other restrictions apply in the same way as they do to cars. In some car
parks it is expected that Motorcycles pay and display.

When you issue a penalty charge notice to a motorcycle you should affix it to
the left handle bar by making a sausage shape with the PCN envelope. On
larger motorcycles it may be necessary to use two envelopes to do this.

If possible, you should ask motorcyclists to park at right angles to the kerb to
maximise parking space however this is not mandatory.

Notes

Only notes that relate to an emergency as outlined in another section may be
accepted following a telephone conversation. These must be headed with a
contact number, nature of work and address. If the telephone number is not
answered a PCN should be issued.

All other notes are to be ignored under all circumstances although you should
take a photograph and make a text note if there is one on display.

Pavement Parking


If you find a vehicle that is parked where there is no restriction but it is on the
pavement then you should leave a pavement parking leaflet on that vehicle.
You should only do this when you come across a vehicle whilst on your beat,
you should not stop whilst on transit to do this.

Pay and display machines

You must pass a test token through a pay and display machine before issuing
any PCNs within a bay that the machine serves.

If a machine is not working but another machine can be seen from the out of
order machine you can enforce the bay.

If the machine is not working and there is no machine visible from the out of
order machine you should not enforce the bay.

If you find a vehicle displaying a note saying that the machine was not
working, but it accepts your test token, you should ignore the note and issue a
penalty charge notice.

If a pay and display machine is not working, you should attempt to remedy the
issue. If you are unable to you should use Teams or an email to report the
machine to an SCEO.

Paying by telephone

It is possible to pay by telephone in almost all pay and display bays in Devon.

You must check the pay by phone system before issuing a penalty charge
notice in a pay and display bay.

If a customer is not able to pay by phone this does not exempt them from the
restriction and they should buy a pay and display ticket instead.

If you are unable to check pay by phone you should not enforce pay and
display, however if the systems is down and the customer is unable to pay
and you are unable to check you should continue to enforce.

All digits of a VRM must be correct and a PCN should be issued even if there
is a vehicle which matches all but one digit of a VRM.

Permits **–** Residents Parking

Residents permits are only valid if they match the letter of the zone they are
parked in, are displayed clearly and have the correct VRM. A permit is invalid
the day after it expires, however as we introduce virtual permits the customer
could have ordered a permit, therefore if a permit expired within the last 7
days check MiPermit if a permit has been requested do not issue a PCN. If


the permit expired over 7 days ago issue a PCN. (If unable to check MiPermit
only issue if permit expired over 7 days ago).

If a permit is displayed but the zone is wrong, then you would use a Code 12.
If a permit is displayed and the letter is correct but there is something else
wrong with the permit, you would use a Code 19.

Residents permits are only valid for the vehicle which they were issued. They
are not transferable between vehicles or useable in courtesy cars.

When a vehicle displays two residents permits you should report both of the
permits through the Permit Abuse link on Teams. You should only
acknowledge the latest permit and ignore the older permit.

Permits **–** Visitor Permits

Residents can purchase books of visitors permits for people to use whilst
visiting them.

These are valid for the day they are issue and until 10am the next day. They
are considered invalid 11 minutes after 10am.

The instructions must be followed to the letter by the driver. If there are any
errors of the permit it is considered invalid. This includes where multiple days
or dates are scratched out, where the information has been incorrectly
completed or if the permit is heavily damaged and therefore multiple squares
have been partially scratched.

Permits **–** Essential Visitor Permits

These permits are issued to allow people who need regular visitors such as
carers and people who check in on them to park.

These permits share the same terms and conditions as residents permits.

Permits **–** Business Permits

These permits are issued to allow business actively involved in carrying out
their business within a residential zone.

These permits share the same terms and conditions as residents permits.

Photographs

There are standard photographs that should be taken whenever a PCN is
issued.

You should always take the following photographs:


- Front of the vehicle showing the PCN on the windscreen and the VRM
    on display.
- Full width of the windscreen
- Any sign in the bay or repeater sign within sight of the vehicle
- A context shot showing both the sign and vehicle in the same shot
- Rear of the vehicle showing the VRM

Additional photographs should be taken:

- If there are notes / items on display on the dash board.
- If there are relevant permits or permits that could be considered
    relevant.
- If there is a pay and display ticket on display if you are issuing in pay
    and display.
- If you are issuing in pay and display you should take a photo of the
    tariff card on the nearest machine.
If you are issuing in a zone of any kind you should take a photo of the entry
sign.

Police Officers, Ambulances and Fire Service

Marked emergency services vehicles are exempt on all restrictions if they are
on emergency duties.

Emergency services vehicles will also be considered exempt if on official
duties. In the case of marked vehicles this will be assumed to always be the
case.

In the case of unmarked police cars, these will be treated as exempt as long
as the blue police log book is displayed on the dashboard of the car. Notes,
laminates and other such items do not exempt the car from the restriction as
these are easily forged.

Emergency paramedics making use of their own cars, or doctors making use
of their own car in an emergency are to be considered exempt however
unless they make you aware of this in person you are unlikely to know this

Fire service vehicles that are being used for official duties are exempt.
Members of the fire service using their own private vehicles and expecting to
be allowed to park in contravention as they are on call is not to be permitted
and a PCN issued.

Pregnancy

Being pregnant does not exempt someone from the regulations and expectant
parents are to be treated the same as anyone else.

Public Utilities


Any vehicle that is being used to maintain public utilities or is responding to an
emergency call out relating to a public utility is considered exempt from
restrictions. This includes vehicles that are working on mains electricity / gas /
water on the highway or where their access point is close to the highway, for
example a power junction box in a nearby field. Additionally, this applies to
telecommunications maintenance but only where the work is being carried out
either in a telecommunications box on or near the highway or on telephone
lines. It does not include the installation or set up of home broadband.

Road Signs / Markings **–** Defective, obscured and unclear

There will be occasions where lines and signs are defective.

The most important thing when it comes to enforcement is that there must be
obviousness to the intent of the lining and signage.

Where a sign is required it must be within 30 meters of the vehicle and within
the same bay. In a zone there should be a repeater within line of sight
although in some zones only the entry sign is needed. If there is no sign in a
bay, then you cannot enforce even if there is a sign in a nearby bay visible.

Lines are not required to be completely clear and joined up. Breakages and
other missing sections are acceptable, but it needs to be possible to see at
least something that shows that there is a bay or line in any photographs that
you take.

If lines are not visible due to complete concealment or deterioration, then you
should not enforce. If you are unsure then you can take a “practice
photograph” and upload it to Teams for advice.

Royal Mail

Royal Mail vehicles that are used for the collection or delivery of postal
packets are exempt from the regulations if they are actively involved in the
activity. This excludes Clearways, School Keep Clear Markings, Pedestrian
Crossing Zig-Zags and Bus Stops.

Scaffolders

Scaffolders may park in any location where loading is permitted for as long as
it takes to construct or deconstruct scaffolding. Unlike loading, other activities,
such as the erection of the scaffolding, can be considered exemptible as
loading. This is because scaffolding crews typically need to unload parts of
the scaffold once at a time to avoid leaving large volumes of materials on the
highway.

Schools


In the immediate vicinity of schools, enforcement at school pick up and drop
off times will focus on safety critical restrictions (no stopping zig-zags, no
waiting/no loading) and excessive waiting on yellow lines and in residents
parking zones. CEO’s will only act on additional specific issues at these times
as instructed by SCEO/TL if/as issues are raised in certain areas.

If not in the immediate vicinity of the school standard enforcement will occur at
the pickup/drop off times.

Security Vehicles

Vehicles that are involved in cash collection or transporting bullion may park
near their destination to effect safe delivery and collection.

Suspended Bays

As standard practice the service does not enforce against suspended
restrictions unless requested by the team or persons responsible for
suspending the restriction.

If you are instructed by a SCEO or Team Leader to enforce a suspended
restriction you should make sure that the signs and/or cones are correct. You
will be advised of what to expect when you are given the instruction to
enforce.

Trade Permits (Annual Variety)

When you come across an annual trade permit you first need to check the
following things:

- The permit is displayed and valid (In date)
- The driver has left details of what address they are working at
- The driver has left a contact telephone number.

If any of the above three things are incorrect or missing a PCN should be
issued.

Next you must ensure that TWO of the following three things are met.

- The vehicle is within 50 meters of the property
- The vehicle is within clear line of site of the property
- The vehicle is within two streets of the property

The terms and conditions of the permit make it clear that the vehicle must be
at the address where work is being carried out. These qualifications ensure
that a vehicle is not unfairly penalised because there was not a space
immediately outside the address but also ensure that it is not being used for
commuting.


It is not necessary to contact the driver to confirm they are working if these
criteria are met but if you suspect that the vehicle is not being used for work
purposes then you should report this to a Team Leader or SCEO who will
arrange for the permit to be investigated.

There is no grace period on an annual trade permit and it is considered invalid
the day after expiry.

Trader Permit (Temporary Variety)

These permits are only available digitally. When you enter a vehicle on your
handheld and it alerts you that the vehicle has a (TP) permit then you should
not continue with the issue of the PCN if it is parked in Residents Parking or
Limited Waiting.

The handheld manages the validity of the permit for you.

These permits are valid only in the location they are issued for.

If you are instructed to issue a Trader Permit in residents parking by a SCEO
or TL you should use a Code 19.

Trade Permit (Scratch card variety)

These scratch cards are valid if there is one day scratched out with a time
scratched out. If there are multiple days scratched off, or multiple times, then
it is invalid and a PCN should be issued.

A PCN should not be issued to an expired permit until 11 minutes after expiry.

Waiver Permit

These permits are only available digitally. When you enter a vehicle on your
handheld and it alerts you that the vehicle has a (PW) permit then you should
not continue with the issue of the PCN if it is parked on yellow lines.

The handheld manages the validity of the permit for you.

These permits are valid only in the location they are issued for.

Warning Notices

One week before a new residents zone becomes enforceable you may be
asked to place warning notices on all vehicles not displaying a residents
permit.

These warning notices should be affixed to the windscreen in a PCN envelope
in the same way as a PCN.


Window Cleaners

Window Cleaners are exempt in Residents Parking, Pay and Display, Limited
Waiting and Loading Bays provided that they are parked reasonably adjacent
to where they are working and taking water from their vehicle, therefore they
can be considered unloading. However, they must be using the hose and
cannot leave it out as a permit to park.

Appendix ii **–** Reference photographs

01 **–** No Waiting

```
This vehicle is parked with its tyre
footprint on the lines with the yellow
line clearly visible either side of the
tyre, this therefore would receive a
PCN.
```

Issuing a PCN

```
This vehicle has received a PCN. There
are only two locations that a PCN
should be attached to a vehicle like this.
```
```
In normal conditions, the PCN should
be attached on the passenger side of
the windscreen approximately half way
up, where the passengers head would
be if they were sat in the seat.
```
```
If it is very wet and you are unable to
affix the PCN to a windscreen you may
attach the PCN under the windscreen
wiper of the driver’s side of the
windscreen. Any other location is not
acceptable.
```
